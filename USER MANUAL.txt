Welcome to the TextEncryptor wiki/User manual!

All the wiki wrote here works for Text Encryptor 0.8 and above.

Note: my English was somewhat terrible back then when writing this user manual and felt too lazy to rewrite it, sorry!

1 - HOW TO CREATE YOUR OWN ENCRYPTED PATRON.

Please read all the following lines before making your own file.

Open the Data Folder either clicking the button "Data Folder" or 
going by your on. Path: (PATH).
Look for a .txt file called "characters".
MAKE A COPY ON IT AND START WORKING IN THAT FILE. Everytime
you start the program the "characters.txt" file is created again
because of program malfunction control. If you make changes on
"characters.txt" all will be deleted next time you run the program.
Rename the copy of "characters.txt" to, for example, "chars2.txt";
you can name it with any name you want.

Inside the file you will find all the letters of the alphabet 2 times
(uppercase and lowercase), some vowels with accent mark and symbols.
Just next of any letter/simbol you'll see an "=" and next to it the
encrypted equivalent of the letter before seen. Example:

a=xcd;

Syntax: LETTER=ENCRYPTEDEQUIVALENT;

To change the encryption of the, for example, letter "a"
you only have to change the encrypted text contained between the
"=" and the ";" with any other text that you want. Example:

a=ExampleText;

So, keeping in mind that "p=www;", "l=awq;", "e=ppz;" and the
Separator Char is "°", you will get from the word "apple" the
encryption of "ExampleText°www°www°awq°ppz°". Change all the 
encrypted equivalents that you want with no length limitation.

To load the file "chars2.txt":
1-Make sure that the chars file is inside the Data folder.
2-Run the program.
3-Go to options and seek for "Custom Char file".
4-Type the name of the edited chars file (without ".txt") and click
on "Load and save".
5-You will see a "Success!" popup message (if it's enabled) indicating
that "chars2.txt" has been successfully loaded, saved and settled as 
default. You will see as well the program indicating that "chars2" is
the current file of characters.

If there is something wrong syntax inside your file, the program 
will crash, close, and will set the default characters next time 
you start the program.

If the file is not at the correct path or you have mistaken the name 
of the file, there will appear a error message.

RULES OF THE CHARACTERS FILE, not following the next rules will result
in program malfunction:

- DO NOT CHANGE THE SYNTAX OF "letter=encrypt;". If there is a missing
"=", ";", letter or encrypted equivalent it will result in a program crash.

- Do not leave a space between two different syntaxes settings. Example:
"a=abc; b=cvb;c=kei;". It must be like: "a=abc;b=cvd;c=kei;". 
Not doing so will result in a program crash.

- Do not leave a space at the beginning or at the end of the txt file.
There shouldn't be any space. If it is so, it will result in a program crash.

-After reading the previus rule, you may wonder of a syntax letter that appears as
" = ;". That's the syntax to encrypt the space (" "). You can encrypt the space,
though. Example: " =spaceExample;".

Take in consideration: 

1-YOU CAN ADD EVEN MORE CHARS. If there is a letter/simbol that does not exist inside
the file like "&". The program will "encrypt" it as "&". If you want to encrypt that
letter just follow the syntax of "letter=EncryptedEquivalent;" and add it at the
beginning/middle/end of your custom file. For example, inside the default txt 
characters you may find: "q=rr3;w=kks;e=ppz;r=000;t=lxm;y=nam;" you can add it
as the following:

Syntax: "&=EncryptExample;".
Structure: "Beginning... middle... end".


"&=EncryptExample;q=rr3;w=kks;e=ppz;r=000;t=lxm;y=nam;"
"q=rr3;w=kks;e=ppz;r=000;&=EncryptExample;t=lxm;y=nam;&=EncryptExample;"
"q=rr3;w=kks;e=ppz;r=000;t=lxm;y=nam;&=EncryptExample;"

-Do not create of edit letters like them were a letter composed of two or more letters.
Example: "ab=asn;" or "ImALetter=dm4;". Doing so MAY result in program malfunction.
The program will not recognize "ImALetter" and encrypt it as "dm4". It has been
designed to state the first letter at the syntax as the "Normal text" or LightChar and
everything after THE FIRST LETTER as its encrypted equivalent.


- It is recommended to store your custom characters file in a safe place
out of Data Folder. It WILL be safe inside the Data Folder, but it is up
to you save a copy at other place. Remember, if you lose it, you won't be able
to unencrypt text without it.

------------------------------------O------------------------------------

2-SEPARATOR CHAR

The default Separator Char of the program is = "°".

The program needs a simbol or letter that allows it to difference a part of encrypted
text to another. For example, if "a=abc;", the Separator Char is "°" and you try to
encrypt "aaa" you will get: "aaa°aaa°aaa°. 

It is prohibided to include the Separator Char inside "Normal text" because it will
make an incorrect morph of encrypted text to Normal Text. Even though, if you need to
include "°" in the text, you can change it inside the tab of options of the program with
whichever simbol, letter or even number you want; but you won't be able to write that 
character at the encrypt  to box.

It is recommended to keep the Separator Char as "°" because it is quite rarely used
in both Spanish or English languages.

Take in consideration: 

-If you change the Separator Char, it will be remembered by the program. If you want
to reset it, you can do so at the options tab.

-There is a log txt file called "Separator Char changes" inside the Data Folder where 
you can find the changes the user have made to the Separator Char with date and hour.
